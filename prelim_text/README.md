# Problem

Reproducibility of scientific experiments is important for three reasons:

1. The scientific community corrects false claims by applying scrutiny to each others' experiments.
   Scrutinizing an experiment often includes reproducing it.
   Therefore, reproducible experiments may be thoroughly scrutinized.

2. Science works by building off of the work of others.
   Often in extending anothers work, one needs to execute a modified version of their experiment.
   If reproducing the same experiment is difficult, one would expect executing an extended version to be even more so.
   Therefore, reproducible experiments may be easier to extend.

3. The end-goal for some science is to be applied in engineering applications.
   Applying a novel technique on new data involves reproducing a part of the experiment which established the novel technique.
   Therefore, reproducible experiments may be easier to apply in practice.

<!-- TODO
Popper defined reproducibility as a criterion for distinguishing between science and pseudoscience (Hill, 2019 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07530).
-->

Reproducibility also has costs, primarily in human labor needed to explain the experiment beyond that which would be needed to merely disseminate the results.
Working scientists balance the cost of reproducibility with the benefits to society or to themselves.

In real-world experiments, there are an infinitude of possible factors that must be controlled to find the desired result; it would be unfathomable that two instantiations of an experiment could give exactly identical results.
In contrast, for computational science experiments (from here on, **CS Exp**) on digital computers, while there are still many factors to be controlled, perfect reproduction is quite fathomable.
Despite this apparent advantage, CS Exps on digital computers still suffer low rates of reproducibility.

![Effort-vs-reproducibility tradeoff curve in the status quo and with reproducibility tools](./plot0.pdf){#fig:effort width=50%}

The status quo will not change simply by arguing for reproducibility; those arguments are widely known are already taken into account by the efficient market.
Nor do I have the power to change incentives in science funding policy.
However, by reducing the cost of reproducibility, scientists may produce more reproducible experiments with the same effort ([@fig:effort]).
Reducing the cost is a technical problem this work attempts to solve.

For the purposes of this work, "computational scientist" (from here on, **CS**) should be construed broadly, as anyone who uses research software to carry out some investigation.
The term includes people who use research software for data analytics and for simulations, so long as scrutinizability, extensibility, and applicability are motivators.
The term applies to professors in academia as well as analysts in a national lab.

# Background

There have been conflicting sets of definitions for the terms _repeatability_, _reproducibility_, _replicability_ [@plesserReproducibilityVsReplicability2018].
Fortuantely, there is a consensus forming lately.
The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine gave the following definition:

> **Reproducibility**: obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.
>
> --- [@committeeonreproducibilityandreplicabilityinscienceReproducibilityReplicabilityScience2019]

The Association of Computing Machinery gave a compatible definition,

> **Reproducibility**:
> (different team, same experimental setup)
> The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.
>
> --- [@acmincstaff]

This is opposed to **repeatability** (same team, same experimental setup) and **replicability** (different team, different experimental setup).

The ACM definition references more useful auxiliary terms, such as measurement procedure, operating conditions, stated precision, etc., so we will use that one for this work.

Na√Øvely, every CSE would be "reproducible", since there is some, possibly unknown, set of conditions under which another team can make the measurement; i.e., "make your environment bit-wise the same as ours".
To prevent the definition from being vacuous, we will only consider *explicitly stated* operating conditions.

<!-- TODO:

The relevant question is not "is this CSE reproducible?"; nearly every CSE is reproducible (i.e., the result *can* be obtained in very specific conditions).
The relevant question is, "in what conditions is this CSE reproducible"?

Conditions := set of pairs of configuration and value.
One element might be {("what are the contents of file.txt", "hello world"), ...}

-->

These definitions derive from _metrology_, the science of measuring, and we will specialize some of the terms "measurement", "measurement procedure", and "operating conditions" in software context for computational science experiments.

- **Measurement procedure (for CSEs)**:
  The application code and user-interactions required to run the application code (if any).

- **Operating conditions (for CSEs)**:
  A set of conditions the computer system must implement in order to run a certain program.
  E.g., GCC 12 at `/usr/bin/gcc` compiled with certain features enabled.

One may over-specify operating conditions without changing the reproducibility status.
E.g., one might say their software requires GCC 12, but really GCC 12 or 13 would work.
It is quite difficult and often not necessary to know the necessary-and-sufficient set of operating conditions, so in practice, we usually have set of conditions that is sufficient but not necessary to operate the experiment.

Operating conditions can be eliminated by moving them to the measurement procedure.
E.g., the program itself contains a copy of GCC 12.
For the purposes of this work, the operating conditions are the "manual" steps that the user has to take in order to use the measurement procedure to make the measurement.

- **Measurement (for CSEs)**:
  Rather than offer a definition, we give some examples:

  - **Crash-freedom**: program produces result without crashing.
  - **Bitwise equivalence**: output files and streams are bit-wise identical.
  - **Statistical equivalence**: overlapping confidence intervals, etc.
  - **Inferential equivalence**: whether the inference is supported by the output.
  - **Others**: domain-specific measurements/equivalences (e.g., XML-equivalence ignores order of attribtues)

In general, it is difficult to find a measurement that is both easy to assess and scientifically meaningful.

| Measurement             | Easy to assess                             | Scientifically meaningful                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crash-freedom           | Yes; does it crash?                        | Too lenient; could be no-crash but completely opposite result |
| Bitwise equivalence     | Yes                                        | Too strict; could be off by one decimal point                 |
| Statistical equivalence | Maybe; need to know output format          | Maybe; need to know which statistics _can_ be off             |
| Inferential equivalence | No; need domain experts to argue about it  | Yes                                                           |

**Composition of measurement procedures**: The outcome of one measurement may be the input to another measurement procedure.
This can happen in CSEs as well as in physical experiments.
In physical experiments, one may use a device to calibrate (measure) some other device, and use that other device to measure some scientific phenomenon.
Likewise, In CSE, the output of compilation may be used as the input to another CSE.
One can measure a number of relevant properties of the result of a software compilation.

| Compilation measurement            | Definition                                                       |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source equivalence                 | Compilation used exactly the same set of source code as input    |
| Behavioral equivalence             | The resulting binary has the same behavior as some other one     |
| Bit-wise equivalence               | As before, the binary is exactly the same as some other one      |

E.g., suppose one runs `gcc main.c` on two systems and one system uses a different version of `unistd.h`, which is `#included` by `main.c`.
The process (running `gcc main.c`) does not reproduce source-equivalent binaries, but it might reproduce behavior-equivalent binaries or bit-wise equivalent binaries (depending on how different `unistd.h`).

<!-- TODO: Find an appropriate place for the following ideas:

- Differentiate between "non-determinism" (hampers repeatability) and non-portability (hampers reproducibility, but not repeatability)

- Explain cost-benefit from researchers' perspective

- Technology adoption model (Davis 1989)

- "Computational experiment" should also be construed broadly, as any computational process for which, the first time it is run, learning the result contributes to knowledge.
  A script that starts up a web server is not a computational experiment, but a script that computes the mean of novel data on human weight is.

- Most scientists use research software, and many write their own (Hettrick); therefore, methods for reproducible software are important.

- Buckheit and Donoho: "An article about computational sci- ence in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures."

- Anecdotes
  - Reinhart and Rogoff corrected by Herndon et al., 2014 because source availability.
  - A scientist's nightmare (Miller, 2006)
  - Dispute between two fluid dynamics groups referenced by Hinsen

# Related work

There are many related works that address reproducibility.
We will leverage the definitions and framework discussed above to contextualize each work.
Still, there is a significant gap in prior work that this work will exploit.
Prior work can be divided into three categories, which we will investigate in turn, and show how our framework applies:

1. Studying empirical characteristics of reproducibility
2. Studying approaches associated with proactively ensuring reproducibility
3. Studying approaches associated with reactively restoring reproducibility

<!-- TODO:
Overall, we encourage "defense-in-depth" approach that addresses reproducibility from multiple angles.

Synergies exist between multiple approaches.

## Empirical characterization of reproducibility

This group of related work seeks to characterize the degree of reproducibility or a proxy for reproducibility in a sample of CSEs empirically.
A proxy variable could be "whether the source is available", since this is a necessary but not sufficient condition for reproducibility.

[^cb-note]: I am considering the total sample to be only those papers whose results were backed by code, did not require special hardware, and were not excluded due to overlapping author lists, since those are the only ones Collberg and Proebsting attempted to reproduce. I am considering OK<30 and OK>30 as "reproducible crash-free building" because codes labelled OK>Author were not actually reproduced on a new system; it was merely _repeated_ on the authors system [@collbergRepeatabilityComputerSystems2016].

[^t-note]: I am considering the total samples to be the set of _un-repaired_ codes, since those are the ones that actually exist publicly. Also, we _include_ codes for which the time limit was exceeded; reproduction was attempted and not successful in those conditions.

[^p-note]: I am considering the total sample to be only notebooks that were valid, pure Python, and had an unambiguous order, since those are the ones Pimentel et al. attempt to reproduce [@pimentelLargeScaleStudyQuality2019.]

[^w-note]: I am considering the total sample to eb only notebooks that had dependency information and used Python 3.5 or later, since those are the only ones Wang et al. attempted to reproduce [@wangAssessingRestoringReproducibility2021].

[^o-note]: This figure is the average normalized "reproducibility score", based on whether the method, data, and experiment, were available. If it were 1, all the papers in the sample would be have method, data, and experiment availability, and if it were 0, none would be.

[^v-note]: This figure is the average number of computational elements (figures and tables) that were reproduced to semantic equivalence in each paper.

Note that crash-freedom is prevalent because it is the easiest to automatically assess.
Source-availability requires human-intervention to test, so studies on crash-freedom simply begin from a corpus for which source code is available.
Note that stdout-equivalence is feasible because Jupyter Notebooks bundle the stdout with the code; otherwise, the stdout is usually thrown away.

Overall, these studies show that reproducibility is a significant problem.

Some of the studies, like Zhao et al., investigate the _reason_ why some samples were not reproducible [@zhaoWhyWOrkflowsBreak2012], finding

| Reason                                      | Proportion of failures |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Unavailable/inaccessible 3rd party resource | 41%                    |
| Updated 3rd party resource                  | 7%                     |
| Missing example data                        | 14%                    |
| Insufficient execution environment          | 12%                    |
| Insufficient metadata                       | 27%                    |

Zhao et al. remark that provenance could preserve or enable repair for several classes of failures, including unavailability of 3rd party resources and insufficient descriptions.

### What are common reasons software is not reproducible?

We should address one of those.

## Proactively ensuring reproducibility

There are several proposed approach associated with proactively ensuring reproducibility:

| Approach                        | Aspect of reproducibility addressed            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Scientific clouds               | Reduces non-portable operating conditions      |
| Digital artifact archival       | Ensure attainability of operating condition    |
| Workflow managers               | Simplify measurement procedure                 |
| Provenance                      | Identifies operating conditions                |
| Record/replay executions        | Reduces operating conditions                   |
| Version control                 | Versions and distributes measurement procedure |
| Virtualization/containerization | Reduces non-portable operating conditions      |
| Package managers                | Reduces non-portable operating conditions      |
| Literate programming            | Explicates measurements                        |
| Seeding inputs                  | Reduces non-deterministic operating conditions |
| Coding practices                | Reduces non-deterministic operating conditions |
|                                 |                                                |

## Scientific clouds

Scientific clouds aim to address reproducibility by replacing a complex set of operating conditions ("install this, configure that") with a single operating condition: log in to a cloud system.
The cloud system hosts a controlled environment with the rest of the operating conditions already met.
However, storing the environments and running executions in them is expensive.
Either the users have to pay, in which case the computational environment is not "freely accessible", or some institution may sponsor public-access.
Previous scientific clouds have a mixed record, with many going defunct in just a few years, failing in their promise of long-term reproducibility.

He adds that the obligation to provide the source code will lead to papers being accepted based on technically weak criteria and that, according to his opinion, fraud has always existed and never posed a significant problem. However, Drummond supports the concept of open science. -- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07530
