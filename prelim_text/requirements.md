- A balance must be struck between satisfying severe space limitations and providing the most critical details. The proposal is not a binding agreement between the student and the Ph.D. committee on the precise tasks that must be accomplished. Through frequent interactions with Ph.D. committee members, the student can adapt the specific thesis accomplishments as necessary.

- The Thesis Proposal should be between 15 and 25 pages (when single-spaced format). Bibliographic references are not included in this page count (having more references is encouraged). There are no explicit page limits or formatting requirements.

- Three main criteria are usually applied in evaluating a proposal (the first two are similar to the National Science Foundation's guidelines for evaluating research proposals).

  - Intellectual merit: What is the importance of the activity to advancing knowledge or understanding?

  - Expected impact: What impact can be expected in terms of particular research communities and on society in general?

  - Feasibility: How likely are the stated goals to be achieved by the candidate?

- Based on these criteria, the Thesis Proposal should contain:

  - An overview of the state of the art, which helps to show that the candidate has a good grasp of the relevant research fields.

  - A brief summary of research results obtained so far by the candidate. This includes citing prior publications and current submissions produced by the student.

  - A clear description of the remaining problems and goals.

  - Some details of the proposed technical approach.

  - Clear arguments as to why the work is interesting in terms of intellectual merit and expected impact.

  - An explanation of how the goals can be accomplished within the expected amount of time.

- The Thesis Proposal should not be

  - A preliminary draft of the thesis.

  - Particular chapters or parts of the thesis.

  - A survey of the candidate's research field.

  - An existing publication or technical report.
